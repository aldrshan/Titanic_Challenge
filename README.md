# ds_standard_battery
This repo is an attempt at building a standard battey for data science and machine learnig. 
To accomplish this the five overarching steps are:
Collect
Clean
Explore
Model building
Model Deployment
In the Collection phase we should start by pulling data through Kafka. This is a good practice even when using CSV's as any live data will likely need to come throgh Kafka or something similar later.
